# Machine-Learning-Engineer
This repository contains projects done as a part of Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

The nanodegree focuses on deploying models on AWS but also has addition courses for introduction to NLP and CNNs. These courses involved practical knowledge related to implementing LSTM for Natural language processing tasks and CNNs for computer vision related tasks.
I mention the chapters in each course below to give an overview of how each course is divided.
